* Skylight / IBL (sample from a sun disk, add atmosphere / sky background on top)
* World cache improvements
    * Tie world cache to camera, use a log scale for cell size
    * Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method
        * Light sources and other cache entries via choosing a random slice of world_cache_active_cell_indices
    * World cache position jitter within each cell(?)
    * Variance driven world cache update rate, skipping very stable cells
* Get TAA working

* Hierarchal debug menu: A for gbuffer, then 1/2/3/4 for specific textures, etc
* ReSTIR for per-pixel direct light sampling

* Reprojecting screen probes
    * Temporal accumulation
    * Ray guiding using last-frame's probes
* Improve spatiotemporal denoiser
    * Early return for denoise passes for sky pixels or 0 spatial denoising
    * Experiment with mixing spatial denoise into temporal history, either before or after

* Add screenspace GI (SSAO/SSIL)
* Specular lighting
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, documentation, etc
    * "A Fast and Robust Method for Avoiding Self-Intersection"
    * Cull or simplify BLAS/TLAS entries for far away meshes
    * Validate reprojection in seperate pass, store in 1 bit of t_buffer g-channel, and reuse in each temporal pass?
