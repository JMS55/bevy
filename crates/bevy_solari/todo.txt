* Switch pixel jitter from per-pixel random to per-frame halton
* Temporal reprojection for probes / spatiotemporal denoiser for irradiance
* Final TAA pass
* Normal map support
* Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method (direct only, direct + indirect?)
* ReSTIR for per-pixel direct light sampling
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, etc
