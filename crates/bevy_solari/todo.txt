* Validate reprojection in seperate pass, store in 1 bit of t_buffer g-channel, and reuse in each temporal pass?
* ReSTIR for per-pixel direct light sampling

* Reprojecting screen probes
    * Temporal accumulation
    * Ray guiding using last-frame's probes
* Improve spatiotemporal denoiser
    * Early return for denoise passes for sky pixels or 0 spatial denoising
    * Experiment with mixing spatial denoise into temporal history, either before or after
* Hierarchal debug menu: A for gbuffer, then 1/2/3/4 for specific textures, etc

* Specular lighting
* Skylight / IBL
* World cache improvements
    * Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method (direct only, direct + indirect?)
    * World cache position jitter within each cell(?)
    * Variance driven world cache update rate, skipping very stable cells
    * Track "access heat map", kill rarely accessed world cells

* Add screenspace GI (SSAO/SSIL)
* Large world optimizations
    * World-space DDGI probes for far irradiance
    * Cull or simplify BLAS/TLAS entries for far away meshes
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, documentation, etc
