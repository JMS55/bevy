* Normal map support
* Figure out screen probe flickering problem (depth imprecision?)
* Switch pixel jitter from per-pixel random to per-frame halton
* Temporal reprojection for probes / spatiotemporal denoiser for irradiance

* Reservoir sampling for the world cache update method (direct only, direct + indirect?)
* Try adaptive blend rate for world cache (https://github.com/Apress/ray-tracing-gems/blob/master/Ch_25_Hybrid_Rendering_for_Real-Time_Ray_Tracing/MultiscaleMeanEstimator.hlsl)
* ReSTIR for per-pixel direct light sampling
* Add screenspace GI (SSAO/SSIL)
* Cleanup, remaining TODOs, performance profiling, etc
    * Combine pipeline rust code into one module/struct/system
